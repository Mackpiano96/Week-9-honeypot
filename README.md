# Week-9-honeypot

  I deployed the Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP honeypot. I followed the step by step instructions provided to deploy the honeypot in the Google Cloud Provider.	For the most part was able to follow the instructions provided by the lab, however I faced some difficulties when the directions were somewhat outdated and I had to change some of the scripts provided. In one case I had to delete my firewall and re-install it.	In the first 10 minutes of my honeypot existing, I had well over 100 hackers trying to access the honeypot. Most of these hackers were from Lithuania, however there were a few from the Netherlands, and one from the United States.
